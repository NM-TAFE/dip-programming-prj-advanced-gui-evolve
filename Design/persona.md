## User story
As a visual impaired user, I would like to access this software at a lower price without being 
faced with high 'token' fees from third party services.

## Persona: [Alice]

## Background
No experience in coding, currently studying Cert IV Programming.

## Goals
She needs more time to understand the lectures, and hope to 
store the code, so she can access the code anytime as the lectures are too fast

## Needs
She requires a software to help her understand programming concepts at her own pace.
The ability to access and review the code independently, without replying on expensive services.

### Pain points
1. Third-party services charge high 'token' fees.
2. Fast pace of classroom lectures makes it difficult for Alice to keep up.
3. Finding resources that are accessible for visually impaired users can be challenging.
4. Alice want to be able to learn by her owns.

## Relevant issue
Code validation preprocessor & bookmarked extraction points

By doing a preprocessing, we can eliminate most of the unnecessary (image to text) 
when we passed to OpenAI. This will reduce the token fees needed from the third party services.

Bookmarked extraction point can direct the user to the timestamp where code exist.
