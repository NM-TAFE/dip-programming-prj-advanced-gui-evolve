Issues and ideas:

- issues with code capturing when video screen is split
- IDE feature does not seem work
- key option for capturing frame and pausing video
- button and key for copying captured code to clipboard
- capture code only (ignore line numbers, file name etc.)
- integrate screen reader to read code (and add button and key option to activate)
- add pagination for code captures (instead of the current scrollable display)

Possible user stories:

- As a user, when there are other elements in the video, I'd like to capture code only, so that I can copy and paste it into my IDE.

- As a user, I would like to paginate between captured codes so that I can use the screen reader with them in a more accessible way.
